// Here place the desired item scripts you want to add in the Addon.
// Make sure they refer to existing files and directories.
// Example: 
	//	"TEMPLATE/NEWITEMS.d" (because there's a directory called TEMPLATE which may contain the script)
	// or 
	//	"NEWITEMS/ARMORS.d" (if the directory with the files is named NEWITEMS)
// Without quotations of course.
